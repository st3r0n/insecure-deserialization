##########################PHP###############################################
$user->name = "carlos";
$user->isLoggedIn = true;     # deserialized

when serialized it looks like 
O:4:"User":2:{s:4:"name":s:6:"carlos"; s:10:"isLoggedIn":b:1;}

look for code such as serialize and unserialize

modifying data types
if == is used in php 5=="5" evalutaed to be true also 5=="5 of soomething" is true
in short if anything starts with 5 becomes true

0 == "Example string" // true

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++JAVA+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
java serializez to buyte streams which may start with ac ed in hexadecimal and rO0 in Base64. 
functions used ----> java.io.Serializable , readObject() , InputStream

you can modu=ify the serialized data directly or using an script
LAB1: just modu=ify the base 64 encoded cookie and changealue of isAdmini to 1
LAB 2 : use of data types in php to change token value to 0 so it evaluates to true # dont forget to change data type of token 

$$$$$$$ when you modify an object u need to hcange its data type too to the new onject data type

------------------USING APPLICATION FUNCTIONALITY----------------------------
we can use apllications functionality to do insecure task like deltinga file
eg. when delting an account the user avatar may be deleted so we can look at cookie for any modifiable values



MAGIC METHODS
invoked automatically when an onbject is created like constructors
eg __init__ etc anything that starts with double underscore
if user controllable data can modify magic methods we can create our own methods a



INJECTING ARBITRARY OBJECTS
study the server side language and construct payload based on it 
if we have source code we can construct whatever we want
